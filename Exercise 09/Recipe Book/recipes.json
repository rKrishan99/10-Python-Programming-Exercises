        "instructions": "Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. In a pan, cook the pancetta or guanciale over medium heat until crispy. In a bowl, beat the eggs and mix in the grated Pecorino Romano cheese and a generous amount of black pepper. Once the spaghetti is cooked, reserve some pasta water, then drain the spaghetti and add it to the pan with the pancetta. Remove the pan from the heat and quickly mix in the egg and cheese mixture, adding reserved pasta water as needed to create a creamy sauce. Serve immediately with extra grated cheese and black pepper on top."
